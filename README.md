## Overview

This project implements a video classification model that can automatically detect shoplifting behavior from surveillance camera footage. The model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal pattern recognition.

---

## Features

- **Custom CNN-LSTM Architecture**: Built from scratch without pretrained models
- **Pretrained Model Fine-tuning**: R3D-18 (3D ResNet) implementation for enhanced performance
- **Temporal Analysis**: Processes 16 uniformly sampled frames per video
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: Implements class weighting and balanced loss functions
- **Data Augmentation**: Random flips, rotations, and color jittering for better generalization
- **GPU Acceleration**: Full CUDA support for faster training
- **Django Deployment**: Production-ready web application for video upload and prediction

---

## Architecture

### Custom CNN-LSTM Model

The model consists of three main components:

#### 1. CNN Feature Extractor
- 4 convolutional blocks with batch normalization
- Progressive channel expansion (64 â†’ 128 â†’ 256 â†’ 512)
- Max pooling for spatial dimension reduction
- Adaptive average pooling for flexible input sizes

#### 2. Bidirectional LSTM
- 2-layer bidirectional LSTM
- Hidden size: 256
- Captures temporal dependencies across video frames

#### 3. Classifier Head
- Fully connected layers with dropout (0.5)
- ReLU activation
- Binary classification output (Shoplifting vs Normal)

**Model Parameters**: ~15-20 million trainable parameters

### Pretrained R3D-18 Model

- 3D ResNet-18 architecture pretrained on Kinetics dataset
- Modified final layer for binary classification
- Dropout (0.5) for regularization
- Optimized for video understanding tasks

---

## Dataset

- **Classes**: 2 (Non-Shoplifter, Shoplifter)
- **Train/Val/Test Split**: 80/10/10
- **Class Distribution**: 
  - Non-Shoplifter: ~62%
  - Shoplifter: ~38%
- **Video Processing**: 16 frames per video, resized to 112Ã—112 pixels
- **Stratified Splitting**: Maintains class balance across all splits

## Deployment

### Django Web Application

The project includes a Django-based web application for easy model deployment and inference.

**Features:**
- Upload surveillance videos through web interface
- Real-time prediction with confidence scores
- Displays probability distribution for both classes
- Video playback with prediction results

### Setup Instructions

1. **Navigate to deployment folder:**
```
cd deployment/shoplifting_detection
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Place your trained model:**
```
# Copy your .pth model file to:
models/best_3D_CNN_model.pth
```

4. **Run migrations:**
```
python manage.py migrate
```

5. **Start the server:**
```
python manage.py runserver
```

6. **Access the application:**
```
Open browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

7. Display results on web interface

**Prediction Output:**
```
{
  "prediction": "Shoplifting" | "Normal",
  "confidence": 95.67,
  "probabilities": {
    "normal": 4.33,
    "shoplifting": 95.67
  }
}
```
